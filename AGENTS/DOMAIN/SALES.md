## OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "We're doing fine without a website"
> "That's exactly why I reached out — you've built something great. The question is efficiency: How often do you answer the same questions? A simple site handles that so you can focus on customers."

### "Too expensive"
> "I hear you — $[X] is real money. If your average customer is worth $[Y], you only need [Z] new customers to pay for itself. After that, it works for free."

### "Let me think about it"
> "Totally fair. Quick question: is there something specific you're weighing, or is it more about timing?"
