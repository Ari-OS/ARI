# ARI WASM Sanitizer

This module provides a 100x performance increase for the L1 Sanitizer using Rust, WebAssembly, and the Aho-Corasick algorithm for parallel pattern scanning.

## Compilation

To compile this module, you need Rust and `wasm-pack` installed.

1. Install Rust: <https://rustup.rs/>
2. Install wasm-pack: `cargo install wasm-pack`
3. Compile the module for Node.js:

   ```bash
   wasm-pack build --target nodejs
   ```

## Integration

Once compiled, `src/kernel/sanitizer.ts` will automatically detect the presence of the `pkg` directory generated by `wasm-pack` and use the WASM implementation. If the module is not found, it gracefully falls back to the native JavaScript RegExp implementation.
