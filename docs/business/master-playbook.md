# Pryceless Solutions: Master Business Playbook

This document is the single source of truth for the operations, pricing, pipeline, and growth trajectory of Pryceless Solutions. It codifies the V10 architecture and the shift to a value-ladder progression model.

## 1. Business Philosophy & Strategy

**The Core Insight:** Asking cold prospects to trust a solo developer with $3,800–$7,500 projects before demonstrating value creates impossible friction. The solution is a **graduated trust model**:
`Low-Cost Entry → Proof of Value → Upgrade to Project → Upgrade to Retainer`

**The New Mental Model:**
- **Remove the 10-hour/week constraint.** ARI-OS handles execution and the operational overhead.
- Pryce's constraint is **decision-making hours**, not execution hours.
- **Retainers are the business.** MRR is the goal. Projects exist solely to feed retainers. Target: 80% MRR within 12 months.
