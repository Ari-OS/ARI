# ARI Daily Leverage Guide: The Master Operations Manual

**V10 - Pure Cloud & MCP Edition**

Welcome to the new era of Artificial Reasoning Intelligence. ARI is now a proactive, omnipresent ecosystem strictly routed through high-performance cloud APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini). Local MLX/Ollama models and career tracking logic have been permanently excised to ensure maximum reasoning capability and a 100% focus on revenue automation.

## 1. Kernel Resiliency & MCP Integration

ARI utilizes Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to seamlessly interface with the environment natively.

### 1.1 The Watchdog Process

- **Purpose**: True self-healing and continuous uptime.
- **Capabilities**: The `ari-watchdog` process runs alongside `ari-kernel`. If the kernel crashes, the Watchdog captures the stack trace, feeds it to Claude Opus via the GitHub MCP, applies the generated patch, runs the 5,400+ test suite, and restarts the kernel.

### 1.2 Active MCP Servers

- **GitHub MCP**: Native read/write access for ARI to audit its repositories, review PRs, and push code.
- **Filesystem MCP**: Secure access to `/Users/ari/RawFootage` and `/ProcessedFootage` for the Production Pod.
- **SQLite MCP**: Natural SQL querying of WAL-mode memory and CRM databases.

## 2. Visual UX & "Chronos" Pipeline

Data presentation is now flawless and highly visual. No more text walls.

### 2.1 The "Rich Media" Telegram Interface

- **Dynamic Charting**: ARI integrates QuickChart API to send clean, dark-mode line/bar charts directly in chat.
- **Automated Screenshots**: Browserbase integration allows ARI to snap headless screenshots of competitor sites or trending eBay listings for instant visual verification.
- **Subtle Formatting & Buttons**: Data uses strategic emojis (🟢, 🔴, 📈) and inline Telegram buttons (`[✅ Approve]`, `[🔗 View Live]`) for 1-tap actions.

### 2.2 The "Chronos" Biological Alignment Schedule

Notifications map perfectly to your daily rhythm. (P0 Critical Threats bypass this schedule via Twilio SMS).

- **07:00 AM (The Vanguard Digest)**: P3 digest. Trading Trail market charts, daily Pryceless leads, and itinerary.
- **12:00 PM (The Midday Sync)**: P2 updates. Actionable CRM replies and negotiation escalations.
- **17:00 PM (The Studio Gate)**: P1 alerts. Video render completions with thumbnails for 1-tap approval.
- **20:00 PM (Sundays - Strategy Review)**: Weekly business analysis.

## 3. The "Production Pod" (Trading Trail)

- **Autonomous Alpha**: Ingests transcripts from Pokeplumber, Nostalginomics, etc. Cross-references with TCGPlayer API to flag `BUY_WINDOW` opportunities before spikes happen.
- **Warehouse Studio Render Engine**: Drop a raw `.mp4` into `/Users/ari/RawFootage`. The pipeline triggers:
  - **FFmpeg**: Strips silence.
  - **Remotion**: Renders React-based data overlays syncing with transcripts via AssemblyAI.
  - **Thumbnails**: Uses fal.ai (Flux.1-schnell) composited with Ideogram text overlays.

---

## 4. The "Growth Pod" (Pryceless Solutions)

- **Hyper-Local Sourcing**: Uses Apollo.io and Clay.com to target Southern Indiana businesses (Loogootee, Vincennes, Bloomington) running legacy tech (Wix, WordPress 4, no SSL).
- **Webhook-Driven CRM**: Express.js webhooks listen for Smartlead replies. Claude Opus autonomously analyzes sentiment, handles technical objections, and drops the Calendly link.
- **Programmatic Video Marketing**: Runway Gen-4 (cinematic B-roll) stitched with Creatomate for slick 30-second LinkedIn ads ("Saved 15 hours/week").
