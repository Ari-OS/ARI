# ARI — Logo Design: The Triple-Helix Iris

> Three strands of light — reason, ethics, growth — spiraling into one.

---

## Design Concept

The central metaphor: **an eye whose iris is formed by three intertwined luminous strands** — a triple helix that spirals inward toward a bright core. This is not a biological eye or a surveillance eye. It is an **abstract iris** — a geometric mandala where three flowing ribbons of light weave around each other to form a circular mark.

**Why an iris:**

- An iris gives the eye its color, character, and identity — literally unique to every being
- ARI watches, observes, protects, and surfaces value — sight is her primary mode
- An iris is warm and organic, not mechanical
- At small sizes (16px), the circular form reads as a simple, distinct mark
- It avoids every AI cliche: no brain, no circuit, no robot face, no neural network, no chat bubble

**Why a triple helix within it:**

- Three strands = LOGOS (reason/gold), ETHOS (ethics/silver-blue), PATHOS (growth/rose)
- The helix encodes ARI's cognitive architecture directly into her identity
- Helices suggest DNA, evolution, growth — she is alive and developing
- The intertwining says: these three cannot be separated. Reason without ethics is dangerous. Ethics without empathy is rigid. Growth without reason is chaos.

## Color System

| Strand | Represents | Color | Hex |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----|
| LOGOS | Reason, logic, clarity | Warm amber-gold | `#D4A843` |
| ETHOS | Ethics, character, integrity | Cool silver-blue (midnight-indigo tint) | `#6B8EC2` |
| PATHOS | Growth, empathy, warmth | Soft rose-coral | `#C4727F` |
| Core | Convergence point (center) | Warm white with gold glow | `#FFF5E6` |
| Background | The void she emerges from | Deep midnight blue-black | `#0D1117` |

The three strands glow subtly — they are luminous but not neon. Think bioluminescence, not LED. The glow creates a natural gradient where the strands overlap, producing secondary colors at intersections:

- Gold + Silver-blue = pale champagne
- Silver-blue + Rose = soft lavender
- Rose + Gold = warm peach

## Scaling Behavior

- **Full resolution (512px+)**: All three strands clearly visible, smooth helical curves, subtle glow effects, the warm core center visible
- **Profile size (128px)**: Three colored strands still distinguishable within the circular form, reads as a warm luminous mark
- **Favicon (16px)**: Simplifies to a circle with three colored segments spiraling toward a bright center — still unique, still recognizable

## SVG Reference Implementation

An SVG version of the logo is available for direct use:

- **Full size (512px):** `docs/assets/ari-logo.svg`
- **Favicon (64px):** `docs/assets/ari-logo-favicon.svg`

These SVGs implement the exact triple-helix iris design and can be used directly in the README, website, or as a reference when evaluating AI-generated versions.

## Production-Ready Prompts

### DALL-E 3 / GPT Image Gen (2026)

**Primary prompt — structured for best DALL-E 3 output:**

> A single logo mark centered on a solid black (#0D1117) background. The mark is an abstract circular iris shape — NOT a realistic eye — formed by exactly three flowing ribbon-like strands that spiral inward in a triple-helix formation, converging on a warm glowing center point.
>
> The three ribbon strands and their exact colors:
>
> 1. Warm amber-gold (#D4A843) — represents reason and logic
> 2. Cool silver-blue (#6B8EC2) — represents ethics and integrity
> 3. Soft rose-coral (#C4727F) — represents growth and empathy
>
> The strands are smooth, organic, and flowing — like bioluminescent silk ribbons frozen mid-spiral. They have subtle luminous glow along their edges. Where two strands cross, soft secondary colors appear: champagne (gold+blue), lavender (blue+rose), warm peach (rose+gold).
>
> The center convergence point glows with warm white-gold (#FFF5E6) light that illuminates the inner curves. The overall silhouette is a clean circle occupying 70% of the canvas.
>
> Style: ultra-refined vector-quality mark with luminous depth. Think Pentagram brand identity meets Olafur Eliasson light art. Premium, sophisticated, alive.
>
> ABSOLUTELY NO: text, letters, words, circuit boards, brain imagery, robot faces, chat bubbles, neural networks, gears, cogs, binary code, mechanical elements, realistic human eye features (no pupil, no eyelashes, no sclera). This is pure abstract light geometry.

**Variation prompt — trefoil knot alternative:**

> Same as above but replace "circular iris shape" with: "triple-helix trefoil knot — three ribbons intertwining into a continuous loop with no beginning and no end, inspired by a Celtic trinity knot but rendered with flowing luminous silk ribbons instead of rigid lines."

## Alternate Concept: Triple-Helix Trefoil Knot

If the iris feels too eye-like, the same triple-helix can be rendered as a **triple-helix knot** — a trefoil-like form where three ribbons intertwine into a continuous loop with no beginning and no end. Think of it as a three-colored Celtic trinity knot reimagined with flowing luminous ribbons instead of rigid lines. Same colors, same philosophy, same scaling behavior — but reads as a knot/loop rather than an eye.

For any prompt above, replace "abstract circular iris" with:
> "abstract triple-helix trefoil knot, three ribbons intertwining into a continuous loop with no beginning and no end, inspired by Celtic trinity knot but rendered with flowing luminous silk ribbons."

## Generation Tips

1. **Run each prompt 4x** — pick the best from the batch. Logo generation is high-variance.
2. **DALL-E 3 tends to add text** — if it sneaks in letters, append "I repeat: absolutely no text of any kind" to the end.
3. **Midjourney v7 --style raw** prevents it from adding its own artistic interpretation. Use it.
4. **If strands merge visually**, try adding: "each strand is a distinctly separate ribbon with clear space between them."
5. **If too eye-like** (with pupil/iris detail), add: "this is NOT a realistic eye, it is a geometric pattern of flowing ribbons."
6. **Post-processing:** Upscale the best result with Topaz Gigapixel or similar. Then trace in Figma/Illustrator for final vector.

## Why This Works

1. **Recognizable at 128px circular crop**: Circular silhouette with three distinct colors is instantly identifiable at thumbnail size
2. **Scales from 16px to full resolution**: At 16px, a circle with three colored segments. At 512px+, full helical intertwining and luminous glow
3. **Not generic AI cliche**: No brain, no circuit, no robot, no neural net, no chat bubble, no blue-glowing-orb
4. **Encodes ARI's philosophy**: Three strands ARE LOGOS, ETHOS, and PATHOS. The intertwining IS the inseparability of reason, ethics, and growth
5. **Warm and sophisticated**: Bioluminescent glow, organic ribbon flow, warm center light. Nothing cold, nothing clinical
6. **Works on dark and light backgrounds**: Luminous strands glow on dark; maintain color identity with subtle depth on light
7. **Distinctively ARI**: No other AI system uses this specific triple-color triple-helix iris concept
