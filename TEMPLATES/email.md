# OUTREACH EMAILS

## Cold Outreach - Tourism Hook

**Subject:** Quick question about {{CLIENT_NAME}}

**Body:**
```
Hi {{CONTACT_NAME}},

I was looking at {{CLIENT_NAME}} and noticed you don't have a website yet.

[X] people visit [attraction] every year. When they search for [service type] nearby, they're finding your competitors instead of you.

I build simple, professional websites for [industry] businesses — mobile-friendly, easy to update, and designed to bring in new customers.

Would you be interested in seeing what a site for {{CLIENT_NAME}} could look like? I can put together a free mockup — no strings attached.

Worth a quick look?

## Cold Outreach - Legacy Hook

**Subject:** {{CLIENT_NAME}}'s story deserves to be told

**Body:**
```
Hi {{CONTACT_NAME}},

[X] years in business is impressive. {{CLIENT_NAME}} has clearly built something that matters.

But when people search for [service] in [area], they find businesses with websites first. Your story — your reputation — deserves to show up too.

I help established businesses like yours get online with simple, professional websites. Nothing complicated — just a clean presence that works for you 24/7.

Interested in seeing what that could look like for {{CLIENT_NAME}}?
